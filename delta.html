      <div class="delta-status-bump1"></div>
      <p>Protocol Delta is the protocol developed by CStafford14 to mark his last days on Horizons. When DELTA is announced, preparations for DELTA have commenced. This doed not mean that DELTA has been executed, however. If DELTA was executed, CStafford14 would have published the DELTA video, ownership of all Horizons-related Discord servers will be transferred to EcoBuilder13, and CStafford would no longer be on Horizons.<br /><br />
      When DELTA is in the 'announced' state, this only means there is a possibility that CStafford14 may leave, not that he has or will. DELTA's announcement only means he is considering leaving and/or making preparations to leave. While in the announced state, DELTA can be removed and returned to its 'normal' state. But after DELTA has been executed, there's no going back.</p>
