        <h1>Cesium Cloud Terms of Use</h1>
        <h3>Section 1: Terms</h3>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> The Cesium Cloud is a private service. It was created for the privacy-focused user and friends of Cesium in order to better secure personal data while retaining the convenience of a cloud service.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> While privately owned (thus bypassing some laws), the Cesium Cloud is still responsible for governing terms of use for the service.<br>By signing (required to create an account), you agree to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You will not use the service to store viruses or other malware</li>
          <li>You will not use the service to store illegal content, according to US laws</li>
          <li>You will not use the service to store pornographic content</li>
          <li>You will not use the service to send spam, including to others using the service</li>
          <li>You must comply if another user of the service asks you to stop sending them information</li>
          <li>You will not use the service to plan illegal or harmful activities</li>
          <li>You will not attempt to harm the service, or use the service to harm other services</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1.3</strong> The Cesium Cloud is not responsible for data loss or any consequence you may receive by using the service. If there is reasonable suspicion of a ToS violation, your account may be investigated. Otherwise, administration is given with a hands-off approach, meaning that no action will ever be taken from the administration unless proven necessary.</p>
        <h3>Section 2: Security</h3>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> The Cesium Cloud is secured with modern encryption and authentication standards. Your account is required to modify data owned by you stored on the service. Without account access, your data is protected. Your account is your responsibility and thus the Cesium Cloud is not liable for actions taken with accounts. Two-factor Authentication (2FA) is <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged and is one of the best methods to protect against account takeovers. The Cesium Cloud is not responsible for account takeovers or data loss. Please choose a strong unique to the service and set up 2FA.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2</strong> As stated before, your data stored on the service is only visible to you. If it is suspected that you have broken a law or violated the ToS, your account data may be investigated. The best method to avoid this is to use the service as defined by the terms of service.</p>
          
        <h3>Section 3: Guests</h3>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> The Cesium Cloud allows for the creation of guest accounts and users. Guests can access most parts of the service within the bounds defined by the user extending the invitation. The user extending the invitation is responsible for all activity of the guests they invite.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2</strong> If a guest desires to upgrade their account to a normal account rather than a guest account, they will have to submit an application much like the application to use the service.</p>
          
        <h3>Section 4: Limitations</h3>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> The Cesium Cloud is privately owned on privately owned residential property. The service will refuse access by any 3rd party unless one of the following applies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The user enables 3rd party access, such as social login</li>
            <li>A government official of the United States of America appears with a search warrant
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>4.2</strong> Upon request from the government, the Cesium Cloud will <strong>not</strong> comply. Your data will never be sent to any government. However, if a government official of the United States of America appears with a search warrant, the service is legally bound to give data. The service will try to maintain privacy by giving access to only the data requested, restricting access to other accounts or data not requested. However, this is not guaranteed.</p>
          <p><strong>4.3</strong> The Cesium Cloud is not responsible for anything. You agree not to hold Cesium or the Cesium Cloud accountable for any issues, except where the service has violated the ToS.</p>
          <p><strong>4.4</strong> By signing, you are bound by these terms. The following conditions apply as "signing":</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Clicking "Sign" or "I Agree" when confronted with the terms</li>
          <li>Using the service</li>
        </ul>
