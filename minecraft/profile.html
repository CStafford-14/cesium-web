  <div><p class="bodytext">This is me :)</p><br>
<p class="bodytext">This is just a really simple skin I made for myself so that I wouldn't be considered a noob on Minecraft. Personally, I think it's one of the greatest games on the planet.</p><br>

<p class="bodytext">My skin features a generic green hoodie with the noise texture pattern. I just drew all over with the "Autotone" feature and I have a decent-looking jacket.</p>
<br>

<p class="bodytext">I always have blue jeans on IRL, so I kept the theme here. No shorts! Once again, I just went wild with autotone. Same thing for the shoes, just some light gray shoes like the ones I wear in real life.</p>
<br>

<p class="bodytext">In 2020, I added the mask for obvious reasons. If I could, I'd make a mod that adds them to the game. That way, you can still wear ir without having to mess with your skin</p><p class="bodytext">Joy!</p>
<br>
<p class="bodytext">This page uses <a href="https://visage.surgeplay.com">Visage</a> to show you what my skin looks like at this moment. Each time I update it in-game, you'll see it here.</p>
  <br/><br/>
  <p class="bodytext" style="font-size: 16pt;font-weight: 600;">2020 Refresh</p>
<p class="bodytext">I decided to redesign my skin on September 26, 2020. This is a small refresh to the familiar face. Now, the hoodie has been moved to the outer later to feature a tee shirt underneath it with "55" on the front. 55 is the atomic number for Cesium, so I think you know why I chose it. The mask was then changed to blue with black straps to match what I have now. Also, my shoes were changed to black to match my current shoes, too.</p><br>
<p class="bodytext">I hope you enjoy this refresh!</p>

<p class="bannertext">The Turtle Cape</p>
<div class="cbox">
  <div><p class="bodytext">Oh yeah, I also have a cape.</p><br>
<p class="bodytext">I saw this free cape and decided to apply it. It's just one of those random things I've picked up over the years.</p><br>
<p class="bodytext">I've never actually been to minecon, so I'm just using a mod to view the cape. If you want to see me with the cape or get one yourself, head over to the <a href="https://minecraftcapes.co.uk/">Minecraft Capes</a> website. It's a mod that you install on Fabric or Forge that gives you a cape and lets you see others with capes. Enjoy!</p><br/><br/>
<p class="bodytext">Oh, this does use my old skin. I should change this soon...</p>
